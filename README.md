# CTF — Capture The Flag Write ups

This folder contains write ups from **CTF challenges** that I solved as part of my process in cybersecurity.

The focus here is on:
- understanding vulnerabilities
- breaking down the logic behind a challenge
- explaining how and why a solution works

---

## What you will find here

Inside this folder, you may find write ups related to:

- Web security challenges
- Linux and privilege escalation
- Authentication and access control flaws
- Enumeration and misconfigurations

Each write up documents the **thought process**, not just the final flag.

## How I approach CTFs

I approach CTFs like puzzles:

- Observe how the system behaves
- Look for assumptions and weak points
- Test ideas incrementally
- Learn from mistakes when something doesn’t work

I’m more interested in *why* something breaks than in rushing to the solution.

## Why CTFs are useful

CTFs help build:
- technical intuition
- pattern recognition
- confidence in unfamiliar systems

They also expose common mistakes that appear in real world environments, especially around logic, configuration, and trust boundaries.

## Notes

- These write ups are for educational purposes
- They reflect my reasoning at the time of solving
- The goal is learning and clarity, not perfection
